**a painter, illustrator, and book artist** using traditional materials such as pastels, charcoal, oils, gouache, colored pencil, ink, and cut paper. Painting portraits is at the heart of my art practice, and my favorite projects allow me to grow and learn.
#### I'm a self-directed artist...
I use the term "self-directed" instead of "self-taught" because I've had help along the way, but I've had to [develop my own curriculum](/tags/self-taught-artist/) and be very self-disciplined. I've worked with some stellar instructors such as <a href="http://www.corneliahernes.com/" target="_blank">Cornelia Hernes</a>, <a href="https://www.stephenbaumanartwork.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Bauman</a>, and <a href="https://www.sophieploeg.com/" target="_blank">Sophie Ploeg</a> along the way. These artists taught me how to make portraits. I also have collected a lot of [terrific books](../blog/learning-list-for-self-taught-artists/), watch YouTube tutorials, and am a member of the Portrait Society of America, which has an awesome yearly conference and a Wednesday demo series. **And I practice A LOT.**
#### There are stories everywhere...
and I try to imbue all of my work - even portraiture - with some sort of emotional narrative. In my work I try to create spaces of beauty, delicious emotion, and introspection. Right now, I'm trying to create a sense of quiet with natural and delicate color harmonies and shape design.
#### From The Easel is...
where I write about processing the world through images and sometimes packaging up those collections in a handmade book. I share my journey as a self-directed fine artist in the Classical Realist tradition, as well as my quest to develop my illustration style.

On the blog, you'll find [practical tutorials](/categories/tutorials/index.html) about visual journaling, fine art, book arts, drawing, painting, making portraits, art materials, and much more. You can also stay up to date with [studio projects](/categories/studio-projects/index.html), and finally I occasionally share [my thoughts about creativity and life](/categories/an-artists-thoughts/index.html).
#### My goal for this space...
is to provide information and camaraderie. I hope to provide my readers with tools, tips and inspiration I had or wished I had as I worked to develop my artistic practice. If you'd like to see a specific tutorial, or ask a question related to the topics on this site, just [send me an email](mailto:info@susannahfisher.art).
#### A little bit about me...
* My Favorite Subject: Faces, people - I love painting portraits more than anything.
* Favorite Scent: Pine mixed with sea air
* Current Color Obsession: Kings Blue Light by Michael Harding (oil paint) - I'm adding it to my skin tone mixes when they need cooling down. It's such a delicate color, but does the job it's asked!
* Influences:  They run the gamut from 16th century Dutch painters to late 19th century artists to Art Nouveau to modern illustrators like Maira Kalman.
* Dessert Addiction: The apple tart from Baking With Less Sugar by Joanne Chang (owner of Flour Bakery in Boston, MA)
* Creative Outlet: Knitting and making handspun yarn
* Dream Project: Traveling around the continent in a Roadtrek Zion van recording people's stories and painting their portraits. Sort of Storycorps meets Dutch Tronies of the 16th century.

I've lived many places all over the United States, but found home in New England. I live near a national park and work from a studio that overlooks the woods where a Barred Owl family resides. When I’m not making art, I’m voraciously reading, taking long walks, knitting, and trying to be a better human.
