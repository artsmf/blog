Hiya! I'm Susannah, a painter, illustrator, and book artist using traditional materials such as pastels, charcoal, oils, gouache, colored pencil, ink, and cut paper. Painting portraits is at the heart of my art practice, and my favorite projects allow me to grow and learn.

I look for stories everywhere and try to imbue all of my work - even portraiture - with some sort of emotional narrative. In my work I try to create spaces of beauty, delicious emotion, and introspection. Right now, I'm trying to create a sense of quiet with natural and delicate color harmonies and shape design.

* I have a New England soul, although I'm originally from the US West Coast. 
* My Season: I love them all, but Autumn is my favorite.
* Lifeblood: Coffee
* Favorite Scent: Pine mixed with sea air
* Current Color Obsession: Kings Blue Light by Michael Harding - I'm adding it to all my shadow mixes and to cool down skin tones. It's such a delicate color, but does the job it's asked!
* Dessert Addiction: The apple tart from Baking With Less Sugar by Joanne Chang (owner of Flour Bakery in Boston, MA)
* Creative Outlet: Knitting and making handspun yarn
* Dream Project: Combine oral history and painting by traveling around taking down people's stories and painting their portraits. Sort of Storycorps meets Dutch Tronies of the 16th century.
* Strength: Determination
* Weakness: Anxiety

I've lived many places all over the United States, but found home in New England. I live near a national park and work from a studio that overlooks the woods where a Barred Owl family resides. When I’m not making art, I’m voraciously reading, taking long walks, knitting, trying to be a better human, or hanging out with my fur family.
