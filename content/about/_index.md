**a painter, illustrator, and book artist**. I use traditional materials such as pastels, charcoal, oils, gouache, colored pencil, and ink. Painting portraits is at the heart of my art practice, and while I like to incorporate other subjects, the body of my work is figurative.
#### I'm a self-directed artist...
I use the term "self-directed" instead of "self-taught" because I've had help along the way, but I've had to [develop my own curriculum](/tags/self-taught-artist/) and be very self-disciplined. I've worked with some stellar instructors such as <a href="https://robertliberace.com" target="_blank">Robert Liberace</a>, <a href="http://www.corneliahernes.com/" target="_blank">Cornelia Hernes</a>, <a href="https://www.stephenbaumanartwork.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Bauman</a>, and <a href="https://www.sophieploeg.com/" target="_blank">Sophie Ploeg</a> along the way. These artists taught me how to make portraits. I also collect [terrific books](../blog/learning-list-for-self-taught-artists/) about art making, watch YouTube tutorials, and am a member of the Portrait Society of America, which has an awesome yearly conference and a Wednesday demo series. **And I practice A LOT.**
#### Recently, I've begun to explore illustration...
and the idea of telling stories with pictures in the form of books. This is a return to my interest in book arts and bookbinding (I worked in book and paper conservation in my 20s and 30s). It's been an exciting pivot in my art practice as it's expanding my traditional notions of image making and communication.

I try to imbue all of my work - even portraiture - with some sort of emotional narrative. I try to create spaces of beauty, delicious emotion, and introspection.
#### A few fun facts...
* Current Color Obsession: Kings Blue Light by Michael Harding (oil paint) - I'm adding it to my skin tone mixes when they need cooling down. It's such a delicate color, but does the job it's asked!
* Current Medium Obsession: Cut paper and collage - I'm discovering how to incorporate it into drawing and painting, and having a blast with my experiments!
* My favorite color pencil: I have two - both Caran d'Ache Luminance - Violet Grey (for shadows) and Paynes Grey (to sketch).
* Influences:  They run the gamut from 16th century Dutch painters to late 19th century artists to Art Nouveau to modern illustrators like Maira Kalman.
* Dream Project: Traveling around the continent in a Roadtrek Zion van recording people's stories and making their portraits. Sort of Storycorps meets Dutch Tronies of the 16th century.
