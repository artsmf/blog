a painter and illustrator interested in visual narratives, natural history, and portraiture. I use traditional materials such as pastels, charcoal, gouache, watercolor, colored pencil, and ink because I love the textures. Each has a personality and quite frankly I love the feel of applying media to paper or canvas.
#### I'm a self-directed artist...
I use the term "self-directed" instead of "self-taught" because I've had help along the way. I've worked with some stellar instructors such as <a href="https://robertliberace.com" target="_blank">Robert Liberace</a>, <a href="http://www.corneliahernes.com/" target="_blank">Cornelia Hernes</a>, <a href="https://www.stephenbaumanartwork.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Bauman</a>, and <a href="https://www.sophieploeg.com/" target="_blank">Sophie Ploeg</a>. These artists taught me how to make portraits and helped strengthen my observation skills. I also collect [terrific books](../blog/learning-list-for-self-taught-artists/) about art making, watch YouTube tutorials, and I practice A LOT.
#### Creating narratives is at the heart of my practice...
and I try to imbue all of my work - even portraiture - with some sort of emotional narrative and to create spaces of beauty and introspection.
#### A few fun facts...
* **Current Color Obsession: Green** - maybe it's the nascent days of spring in the Northern hemisphere, but I'm crazy about the warm, cool, muted, and vibrant greens that are emerging - sometimes all in the same plant!
* **Current Subject Obsession: Birds** - I've taken up a new hobby of bird watching and my nature journal pages have been taken over by these sublime creatures.
* **Current Medium Obsession: Ink** - I've been exploring working with monoliners, dip pens, and brush pens. I love the delicacy of using a 005 black or sepia Micron pen on paper contrasted with the bold line of a Pentel brush pen!
* **My favorite color pencil: Caran d'Ache Luminance Violet Grey** - I love it for adding a quick shadow to my drawings.
#### Dream Project: 
Traveling around the continent in a Roadtrek Zion van recording people's stories and making their portraits. Sort of Storycorps meets Dutch Tronies of the 16th century.
