##### The Naturalist's Notebook
is my free weekly newsletter on Substack for nature lovers and those who want to learn to/or already nature journal. Every week I send out an email with entries from my own journal and tips to create in your own. For subscribers who would like to support my work, I also offer an exclusive monthly newsletter with nature journaling exercises as well as a "how-to" video published mid-month. **Sign up below to join for free or upgrade to a paid subscription.**

##### The Paper and Pigment Party
is a Patreon community for crafters and artists who are interested in making artist's books, paper crafts, calligraphy, and illustration. Every month we have a project with videos and tips.

We work with papers, gouache, ink, colored pencils - and sometimes we mix it all together! All of my content is beginner-friendly whilst also providing a jumping-off point to those who already have some skills.
