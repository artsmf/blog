I love watching the micro expressions that play across our faces. I made this painting while watching one of Sandi Hester's Bits Of An Artist's Life videos on YouTube. She's look off into the distance, so thoughtful as she chose her next words, and I wanted to capture that expression in pastel pigments.  It's a small painting to evoke the feeling of a close conversation with a confidant perhaps.<br>
