I try to find the essence of my sitter in their likeness. It's important to me that there is a thread from me as the artist to my sitter as the subject that is personal, affectionate, and respectful. As for medium, I enjoy using oil paints, soft pastels, charcoal, or graphite - and choose a medium that best expresses the portrait.
