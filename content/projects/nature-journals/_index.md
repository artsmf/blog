In 2019, I completed a natural history illustration certificate course with the University of Newcastle in Australia. I was just getting back to drawing and fresh off of a botanical course but wanted to stretch my skills and learn to draw more scientifically. I've always loved the wild flora and fauna of the places where I've lived, but now I'm very lucky to live on the doorstep of a national park in New England where I can study the changing seasons on the pages of my nature journal.
