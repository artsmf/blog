<figcaption>Ongoing until I reach 100 heads.</figcaption>
I love making portraits the most, but it's not easy. Finding the likeness is being tuned into the placement of someone's features for sure, however to capture true likeness you have to be able to express someone's essence in the moment. Are they sad, joyful, introspective, etc? And how does this affect their features? How am I feeling and how does that affect the outcome? What is the light revealing? Does color affect the mood? I'm considering all of this as I work.
