Illustrator Nicole Cicak has a <a href="https://nicolecicak.com/blog/2022/30-more-sketchbooking-prompts-to-kickstart-creativity" target="_blank">list of prompts on her blog</a> that I find so inspiring, and I'm working my way through the list. My goal with this collection is to stretch my drawing skills and develop my familiarity with gouache, ink, and color pencils.
