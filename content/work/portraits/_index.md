Portraiture is at the heart of my art practice. I find the terrain of the face with it's myriad micro-expressions fascinating. There's a story behind each face that I try to discover through close study and render in paint, pastel, charcoal, or graphite - whatever medium speaks to me at the moment. My goal is always to reveal the beauty within.
