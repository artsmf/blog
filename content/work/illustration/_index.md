For me illustration is a way to collect subjects that support an existing narrative or as a collection form a narrative of their own. I'm inspired by 16th century Dutch painters, 19th century artists, the work of the German abstract expressionist, the Golden Age illustrators, and the modern materials I have on hand. It's always in support of the story.
