Like many, I started making art literally out of a box (a big plastic tub that doubled as a table) in the corner of my living room. When I moved into my current home I had the luxury of a spare bedroom that I used as a home office until I got serious with my art and converted it into my full-time studio. It's still a work in progress, but I'm pleased to give you a tour of my workspace.

### I’m Happy And Very Grateful
After years and years of making art in whatever space I could eke out, I realize how fortunate I am to have a dedicated space. I dream of a bigger space someday with a huge central table where I can invite friends and students who don’t have room in their own homes to make art. I’m putting this out into the universe and on this blog, so we can dream of this space together.
