Have you ever wanted to do something that you didn’t think you had in you to do? So you talk yourself out of it and resign yourself to settle on something different. I did that with art. In this post, I’m sharing my art story and talking about how I became a self-taught artist. And I’ll talk about why I adapted the modern atelier curriculum to teach myself how to draw.

### How did I become an artist? 
I'm not one of those artists who grew up drawing and painting at the age of three. No one put a crayon in my hand so I could recreate the Sistine frescos on my bedroom walls. I didn’t grow up in a family of artists. My parents made things for home and yard, but art did not hang on our walls. 

Like many, I was born with an intense need to create. My creativity manifested in a variety of projects as a child and an adult. In elementary school, I knitted and sewed. In junior high, I added embroidery and doll making. In high school, I made puppets and took up Irish Crochet lacemaking (this started a lifelong love of making all styles of lace). As an adult, I took up spinning because I thought it would be fun to card, spin, and knit wool into sweaters - and it is!

Throughout all this, I dreamed of drawing and painting. So I tried several times. I took an art class in college, got a C, and was not-so-gently told that I had no talent for drawing so I might want to study something else (I did - art history and comparative literature). I took a watercolor class at the art museum where I worked. I joined an urban sketching group. I dabbled in mediums and types of art - printmaking and letterpress printing, book arts, collage, etc. I was able to parlay all this dabbling into a conservation technician job at a museum where I worked on the conservation of books, works of art on paper, and textiles. 

But  I was not an artist.

### A career detour
So I resigned myself to be happy with crafting instead and threw myself into a career in nonprofit communications.

Yet my secret burning desire to be an artist persisted. I wanted to draw people from life. And every time I tried, I failed. My portraits didn't resemble the sitter. Heck, often they didn't even look human! Still, I couldn’t let this dream go. At one point I became a “Davenpeep” and took several [online workshops with Jane Davenport](https://janedavenport.com/online-workshops/) to learn to draw whimsical portraits, mermaids, and storybook characters. It was fun and colorful, but not exactly what I really wanted to do.

In 2017, I had a milestone birthday, and that became a catalyst to a whole host of events that got me off the longest detour of my life and back on the road I was meant to travel. I started an integrated marketing business, which opened up resources for me to explore art again. I went for a comfortable subject and medium - watercolor botanicals but soon became bored. I tried nature journaling, which for me was a little more engaging. Then I took a natural history illustration course that was a lot more engaging. I especially loved drawing wildlife. It was an act of discovery with a pencil, and it was sublime!

I thought I had found my calling, but still something inside of me longed to make more figurative work.

On a lark during the summer of 2019, I took a [5-day pastel portrait workshop with Sophie Ploeg](https://artschool.sophieploeg.com/). She was so clear in her instructions and the course moved so fast with a clear daily goal, that you had no time for self-doubt. Plus I had no expectations that this would be any different than before. My only thought was to enjoy the materials, the camaraderie of my fellow students, and open myself up to discovery rather than get bogged down by “making art.”

O.M.G! I actually created a decent portrait in pastels. The next week I grabbed a copyright-free photo from Pixels and tried to follow the “Ploeg Process” on my own. And I made another decent portrait!

I was hooked and started researching how to create portraits and figures. This is how I found the atelier system of studying art.

### What is the atelier system?
#### Definition and history
Historically, an atelier was the private workshop or studio of a professional artist or craftsman in the fine or decorative arts, where a principal master and a number of assistants and apprentices (i.e. students) work together producing work released under the master’s name. 

In the early 21st century, atelier-style schools of apprentices learning from masters began to crop up all over the world teaching solid drawing and painting skills using a traditional, academic method. Students start by drawing and painting under the direction of a master artist a simple cast model and progress into drawing more complex casts. Students later advance to painting and working from life.  At each stage of the process, the students needed to demonstrate their competency before being allowed to move on to the next stage. 

Modern-day atelier programs students (apprentices) spend about seven hours a day, five days a week learning their craft. From my research, they spend three hours in the morning drawing from Bargue plates (more about this in a future post) and the entire afternoon working from a live model or still life setup. The instructor (or master artist) comes by to offer suggestions and help work out problems in the work. Depending on the atelier, this can happen every day or only a few days a week. There are end-of-the-term critiques, and students only progress to the next, more complex project upon successful completion of the current project. A solid foundation in drawing is acquired before moving to painting (in oils), and the complete atelier program takes anywhere from three to five years to complete.

### Why I’m attracted to these atelier programs and the Academic method of study
For me, these programs fulfill my need to learn strong observation skills and the hand/eye coordination to put what I see onto paper in an organized way (step 1 - observe; step 2 - notate the perimeter of the subject, the big shape; step 3 - notate relationships of smaller shapes, angles, points, and parallels; etc, etc). Having a framework like this gives me something to lean on as I approach more complicated subjects, like a portrait.

I love the organized system of drawing and painting with clear benchmarks. As you progress to more complex projects, you learn to assess and self-correct. Gaining confidence and independence is built into the system as your skills develop, and the ability to solve problems as you work on a piece is invaluable. 

I knew I wanted to work with traditional materials. I’m curious about digital art, but I’m thrilled by the feel of charcoal on good cotton drawing paper. I love how the pigments merge and blend as I apply layer upon layer of pastel to the pumice board that I prepared myself.

### Is it possible to plan and implement a self-study atelier?
Since it isn’t practical for me to attend a program (although if I could, I would in a heartbeat), I used our Covid isolation in 2020 to jumpstart my atelier-style self-study. I learned that some parts of an atelier program are easier than others to adapt to a self-study model..

#### What is easy to manage as a self-study atelier student?
There are a plethora of resources if you want to design an atelier program for yourself. It seems from my research that students start out drawing from Bargue plates. It took me a couple of years to save up for the book, but the plates can be found free on the web. I’ll go into detail next week when I publish my annotated list of resources with links. 

#### What is hard to do as a self-study atelier student?
It being Covid times and all, I’d have to say the most difficult hurdle to overcome was working from life. The second hurdle was the expertise and feedback from a master artist. The third hurdle was the absence of camaraderie of fellow students, and since beginners work alongside their more advanced colleagues, the benefit of seeing your future in the work of peers further along in the program.

#### And what am I doing to solve this for myself?
On the first point, in 2020 life models got very creative and started Zoom sessions to make up the income they were losing when art schools closed in-person learning. While it’s not the same as being in a life study room, if you have a big enough computer screen as I do (27-inch) it’s good enough!

At first, I went at it alone, relying on my books, research, and intuition. But about a year into my self-study, I was able to get funding for almost a year of mentoring from a master artist. Every month we met over Zoom to discuss the work I submitted with questions. I’ll be honest with you, a mentor makes a difference. I had more progress during that year than the year before, but that is not to say that you can’t start on your own. I still made progress that first year, and really it’s better to just start with what you have than to not start waiting for the perfect conditions (which never arrive). 

### What am I modeling my self-study atelier on?
At the core of my self-study are the books by Juliette Aristides, with Lessons In Classical Drawing and Lessons In Classical Painting being the ones I rely on the most. I also base the sequencing of my study on the Florence Academy of Art curriculum. I use a framework called Dreamsmart to set goals and benchmarks, and generally to just stay on track. And since I am primarily a pastel painter, I rely a lot on the book Pastel Painting Atelier by Ellen Eagle.

### Can you really go it alone?
Most certainly! It will be slower progress than if you are actually attending a school like the Florence Academy of Art, but it’s entirely doable if you adjust your expectations. We are our own worst enemy - self-critical, harsh, and more unforgiving of ourselves than we are with others - but I think with an inquisitive mindset, some attainable goals, and perseverance, a self-study atelier program can be a good place to begin.

For the rest of the week, I dive deeper into how I developed my own self-study program. On Wednesday, I’ll have an annotated list (with links) of resources, supplies, and a studio/study schedule. And on Friday I’ll share details of the drawing program I’ve been successfully using followed by the painting program just so that you can see how I’ve pulled it all together for myself.
