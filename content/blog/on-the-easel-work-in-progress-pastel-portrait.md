I am determined to finish this painting this weekend since it's been on my easel for a while - most of that time dormant while I worked on other projects and avoided this one. I find painting people I know and love more difficult than someone I'm not that close to. I've been trying to figure out why. Is it because I know them so well? I'm not sure. I've been avoiding this piece because I need to correct the colors, and I need to "age" the sitter. I've painting elderly people before (my mum is 84). I find the faces beautiful and wise, but tricky to paint because of the detail. I don't try to paint every line, but I do try to capture the texture of age. It's rich and nuanced.

But I think I've put too much pressure on myself to "get it right" instead of just get what is. So to hold myself accountable, here is my progress thus far. I'll publish the finished piece early next week.

So hold me to it. Next week - early next week - I'll post the finished piece. Enjoy your weekend!
