Any kind of self-motivated study is hard. You have to be your own advisor, teacher, grader, and administrator on top of being the student. But I’d rather take on self study than “wait until the time is right/I have XYZ/etc, etc.” Throughout the years of my atelier self-studies, I’ve rotated typically between 2 types of drawing projects: Bargue plates and free drawing. My progress is a lot slower than if I were enrolled in a program, but I am making progress. In the end that is all that matters.

<!--more-->

Below I outline my basic schedule since I started this in 2020 (hello, Pandemic Year, ya ole’ SOB!), but since schedules are highly personal I’ll also walk you through the process I use to plan my atelier year. And as a bonus I’ve added a materials list at the end of this post.

### Planning Your Self-Study Year
#### My Sample Schedules
##### Full-time
In my first year, I focused on the exercises from Lessons in Classical Drawing by Juliette Aristides ([see my Resources post](/blog/learning-list-for-self-taught-artists/)). Since it was 2020, I had a bit more time to devote to this so I kept to an actual atelier schedule: 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon, Monday to Friday. From 9 am to noon, I worked out of the book. Then from 1 pm to 4 pm, I worked on a drawing using a model from Unsplash.

##### Part-time
In 2021, I had work projects but could still devote 2 hours Monday to Friday in the afternoon (2 pm to 4 pm) to working from Bargue plates. I’ll be honest with you, it was hard for me to stay motivated as I find drawing from Bargue plates less than exciting. To keep me motivated, I ended up dividing up my week so that I worked on Bargue for two days and did a “free drawing” from a reference for three days of the week.

##### Extremely part-time
In 2022, my atelier studies fell by the wayside because I had other work (like the collection I’m currently working on, pieces for competition, and some other projects that I can’t talk about right now - ooooo, deliberately mysterious!). However, this blog series has motivated me to begin working on my Bargue drawings again, so my current atelier schedule is Friday afternoons 2 pm to 4 pm, Saturday mornings 10 am to noon, and Sunday afternoons from 1 pm to 3 pm. Oddly, working on the Bargues has become quite relaxing.

### Coming up with a feasible self-study atelier plan
As I wrote in my last post, having goals and a schedule will keep you on track and motivated. Below are some questions to help you articulate your goals and organize your time. Answer all of them or some of them - whatever you need to help you get started.

#### Your vision
What is your long-term goal? Do you want to get better at drawing so that you can keep a visual journal, draw your children, create a portfolio for school or for work, etc?

For me, my overall desire is to develop a visual style based on classical realism. Learning traditional methods of drawing (and painting) will give me the foundation I need to build my own style.

#### Your short-term goal
What is the one thing you want to accomplish at the end of 12 months (6 months, 3 months, 1 month - you decide)? List everything if you can’t decide right now, but prioritize and choose only one when you finalize you finalize your plans.

The first year I did this, my one goal was to be able to accurately create a block-in (focus on line and shapes) drawing of a head from life. This year my goal is to be able to articulate the planes of the head with accurate greyscale values. These aren’t big or complicated goals, but they are achievable and targeted to help me realize my larger vision. That’s the type of goal you want to come up with.

Also, take a bit of time to jot down how achieving this goal will make you feel. Dig deep into your imagination and feel all the feels. Lean into this feeling when you get frustrated. If it helps, come up with a reward. Maybe upgrade to better paper (for those of you who are paper junkies, like me!) when you achieve this goal. Or promise yourself you’ll trade in the yellow #2 pencil for a set of Tombows.

#### Your resources
In other words, what do you have right now to begin and what do you need?

Like I said above, you basically need something to draw with and something to draw on - and of course your reference, like a Bargue plate. Create two columns on some paper to list what you have and what you need to get. Don’t forget time is a resource as well.

##### Here’s my resource list:
###### Have
 - Paper
 - Pencils
 - Kneaded eraser
 - Soft brush

###### Need
 - Bargue plates
 - Cord with weight on one end to use as a plumb line
 - 6 hours a week

#### Your schedule
Now take a look at your commitments and divide them into two categories: Finite and  Flexible.

Finite commitments are all of the obligations that you can’t change, like family and job. Flexible commitments are the things in your life that you can move around and/or cancel, like watching television, shopping, etc. Take a look at your calendar and block out all of the time you spend doing your finite and flexible commitments. If you’ve decided you’re going to devote 6 hours a week to your art practice in say three 2-hour blocks of time, when can you do this? What can you swap out or move around for your atelier time? 

#### Check-ins and self-assessments
The hardest part of a self-study atelier program is assessing your work and staying motivated towards the goal. It’s easy to get discouraged because learning to draw is frustrating. There will be setbacks, and it will seem as if progress is an elusive bee-yahtch! (Pardon my French!)

Or worse, you’ll see progress, and then it will seem as if you are sliding back! This happened to me last year. I had a breakthrough with one of my drawings where I had delicately expressed the nuance of light skating over some folds underneath the eye of my subject. In fact, the whole drawing came together exactly as I had envisioned it. I felt like all my hard work had finally paid off, and it had!

The next drawing I did was a regression. I can’t tell you how deflating it was. I thought that what I had done before was a fluke. I didn’t give up, though. I finished that piece, put it in my folio of horrible drawings, and moved on. The drawings I did after that kept improving.

Art really is cyclical.

So check in weekly by asking the following questions:
 - Did you use the time you blocked off this week? Why or why not?
 - What frustrated you and did/how did you work it out?
 - What worked out well?

I actually keep an “atelier diary” where I record everything I work on - atelier self-study projects, commissions, collections, etc. I write about what went well, what didn’t and my plans for the next day, which I’ll consult at the beginning of the next work session.

So celebrate your wins, push through the hard drawings, and keep practicing.
