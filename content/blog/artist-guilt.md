I experienced something weird over the past few months. I felt guilty every time I worked on projects not directly related to a commission or a contract. Art is my job, so working in my sketchbook is technically a necessary activity in my professional life. Nevertheless, I felt like I was being wicked and lazy for indulging in this “play” and had to ask myself WHY?

<!--more-->
### Why do I feel like I shouldn’t enjoy my job?
When I picked apart the feelings I was having, this is what came up first, and it shook me. I was raised to believe that if you didn’t resent your job, it wasn’t a real job, but I thought I had overcome all the childhood gaslighting by now. This is the behavior that was modeled by the adults in my life while growing up, and it's just straight-up wrong!

Yet here it was, climbing out of its hole to the surface. Because I know better now, I think the guilt may be fear of failure in disguise. Fear has been an ever-present companion throughout my life, except when I’m making art. 

Oh, don’t get me wrong - I have insecurities about my work, but when I’m actually applying paint to canvas or gouache to paper, I’m in a bubble that even fear can’t pierce. This is the zone, you’ve heard so much about.

### Why do I feel like I’m wasting my resources - time, art supplies, etc?
The next feeling I had was that I was wasting my time and precious supplies on work that might “fail.” I could write a whole article on Precious Art Supply Syndrome, or PASS (ha!). I started to think in terms of scarcity rather than abundance, and scarcity is like ambrosia to fear.

It feeds the fear that you won’t have the resources to replace what you’ve used, which snowballs into fear of a lack of skill to use the “good supplies.” This becomes an avalanche of limiting beliefs that keep you from the personal projects that can help expand your skills.

When I think about my previous job as a grants manager I worked on tertiary projects that used up time and resources not directly related to the grant project, but were necessary to keep my department running smoothly and productively. We called these supportive tasks  “administrative work.” So isn’t it logical to think of experimenting with supplies, working in sketchbooks, and trying out new techniques (or practicing existing ones) as “administrative artwork”?

### Why am I afraid of messing up?
Then there is the whole host of feelings associated with perfectionism. That everything I make has to be perfect and consumable by clients, customers, and social media. I love working in my sketchbook and learning by doing, but I constantly battle with making crap art not being valuable.

You’ve heard it before - you have to make a lot of crap to get to the good stuff. I can tell you from experience this is true, but I struggle with this. One of my favorite things to watch on YouTube is sketchbook tours. Probably not a good idea for me since these tours set unrealistic expectations for artists, but I love it! Sometimes our sketchbooks are filled with perfect pages of finished art (well, maybe other people’s - not mine), but seriously that’s so rare. Most of the time it’s filled with scribbles, abandoned work, notes, and the occasional “I suck!” written in a frustrated, heavy hand.

And that’s how it’s supposed to be.
### How am I dealing with these emotions?
#### Practice
I'm literally working through it in my sketchbooks. I acknowledge the guilt and where it comes from, but I keep working anyway. Practice is incredibly valuable for anything you do personally or professionally, including art. No one is born knowing how to do anything (seriously, have you been around a baby?), but we have an incredible aptitude for learning.

I know that I see amazing results when I practice, practice, practice, and my confidence increases. But part of practicing is accepting that there will be setbacks that you just have to work through. It's just part of the process.
#### The Zone
Remember that bubble that even fear and guilt can’t pierce? I will do anything and everything to get into that state, such as giving myself a personal project. I like to use <a href="https://www.creativepeptalk.com/" target="_blank">Andy J Pizza's</a> Creative Side Quest plan to outline the parameters and give myself benchmarks. I choose to immerse myself in a project rather than give oxygen to stifling emotions like guilt and fear. It sounds so easy on paper, but I can tell you from experience even the smallest act of picking up a brush and putting that first mark down is enough to get started. Nothing grandiose, just take it baby step by baby step and see where it leads.
