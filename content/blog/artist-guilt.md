I experienced something weird over the past few months. I felt guilty every time I worked on projects not directly related to a commission or a contract. Art is my job, so exploring new supplies or new ways of using old supplies is technically a necessary activity in my professional life. Nevertheless, I felt like I was being wicked and lazy for indulging in this “play” and had to ask myself WHY?

### Why do I feel like I shouldn’t enjoy my work?
When I picked apart the feelings I was having, this is what came up first, and it shook me. I was raised to believe that if you didn’t resent your job, it wasn’t a real job. It was subtle, but this is what my father modeled in his daily life. He was resentful and hated his job, but he never did anything about it. Didn’t try to retrain to do anything different or something he’d like. He was a pretty good builder of anything - once built a “grandma’s house” - and seemed to enjoy the entire process. Instead he “suffered” at a job he hated and made sure I knew that if I enjoyed my work, it wasn’t a job.

Now I haven’t gone through life resenting my jobs - what an exhausting way to live, right? I’ve always found something to love about the work I was doing. So I was shocked that this insidious, little emotion crept into my mind. 

### Why do I feel like I’m wasting my resources - time, art supplies, etc?
The next feeling I had was that I was wasting my time and precious supplies on work that might “fail” or didn’t lead to a paycheck.  I could write a whole article on Precious Art Supply Syndrome, or PASS (ha!) (actually it’s on my list, so watch for it in a couple of weeks). I had the overwhelming feeling that I should be working on client work even though I am not behind on any of my projects.

I think this is part of the aforementioned feeling, but when I think about my previous job as a grant writer I worked on tertiary projects that weren’t directly related to the grant project. We called it “administrative work.” So isn’t it logical to think of experimenting with supplies as “administrative artwork”?

### Why am I afraid of messing up?
Then there is the whole host of feelings associated with perfectionism. That everything I make has to be perfect and consumable by clients, customers, and social media. I love working in my sketchbook and learning by doing, but I constantly battle with making crap art not being valuable.

You’ve heard it before - you have to make a lot of crap to get to the good stuff. I can tell you from experience this is true, but even I struggle with this. One of my favorite things to watch on YouTube is sketchbook tours. Probably not a good idea for me since these tours set unrealistic expectations for artists, but i love it! Sometimes our sketchbooks are filled with perfect pages of finished art (well, maybe other people’s - not mine), but seriously that’s so rare. Most of the time it’s filled with scribbles, abandoned work, notes, and the occasional “I suck!” written in a frustrated, heavy hand.

And that’s how it’s supposed to be.

### Play is just another word for practice
I wish I had all the answers, but I only know practice is incredibly valuable for anything you do personally or professionally, including art. No one is born knowing how to do anything (seriously, have you been around a baby?), but we have an incredible aptitude for learning.

### How am I dealing with these emotions?
I’m pushing forward and telling myself that practice and experimentation are part of my work. I remind myself that no sketchbook work means I won’t grow my skills or learn about new media that may end up being perfect for future artwork.
