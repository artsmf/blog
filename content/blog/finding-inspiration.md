Happy October! In the studio this month, I explore Caran D’Ache Neocolor II water-soluble crayons. I’m excited to share my explorations with this intriguing medium. I’ll have videos and artwork using this medium almost exclusively throughout the month. Lately, though, I’ve been having artist block (oh, heck, I’ve been blocked since last spring and making tons of garbage art!), and I’m trying to find ways of pushing through by lighting a spark of inspiration.

### Finding Inspiration
For me, artist block is a complex amalgamation of fear, doubt, self-criticism, guilt, frustration, etc., and one of the ways I’ve found that helps is finding inspiration. Inspiration can productively focus your energy and takes you outside of all the negative thoughts and emotions that cause you to become blocked. Unfortunately, it’s a bit of a catch-22. All the negative emotions can make the muse elusive, but she’s an extremely reliable guide around any creative block. 

So I’ve come up with a few techniques that help me:
#### My Inspiration Jar

This is not an original idea, but it is an effective one. I collect ideas on small slips of paper that I roll up and place into a jar. Whenever I’m at a loss for an idea, I can randomly choose from the jar. It’s convenient, and while none of the ideas are elaborate, they are just enough to get me to draw or paint. This leads me to my next technique.

#### Just start something
I know, I know, but sometimes it just takes a doodle or making paint swatches to get inspired. When I swatched my gouache collection, I came up with some fun color combinations that became little illustrations in my sketchbook. Those combinations have made it into some of my oil paintings. So even something as simple as laying down swatches of paint can be inspiring.

#### Take a walk (with a sketchbook)
Nine times out of ten, I have found that a walk can shake me out of a blocked state. The longer the walk the better. For the first part of the walk, I’m still in my head, but later as my body loosens and my eyes begin to open to my environment, ideas begin to flow. I try to write them down (for the jar) or sketch them for later in the studio.

For me, nature is an endless source of inspiration. The color combinations alone are worth it - sometimes all I come back with are swatches of color combinations I found along the way. I’m lucky that right now I live in a rural area, but I used to live in a metropolis and was still able to light the spark of inspiration on my walks.

When I can’t take a “real walk” I’ll just wander around my house (inside and/or outside). The <a href="https://johnmuirlaws.com/blog/" target="_blank">natural history illustrator John Muir Laws</a> teaches an exercise to beginning nature journalists that has been so helpful to me to jumpstart creativity.

##### Draw Inside The Box
This is one of my favorite JML exercises. I do this outside (as originally intended) or inside. Take a long piece of string or twine and lay it down in the shape of a square (a circle or rectangle works too). Take a moment to look at what’s inside the box - focus on textures, shapes, and colors. Then draw what you see. You don’t have to be fancy - pencil and paper are all you need. You’d be amazed at how this can be the perfect starting point.

#### Try A New Art Supply
Choose one art supply and explore it as fully as possible. Swatch it, make tests, and experiment with it. Try to make it fit your work, then try to make your work fit the medium. Try combining it with a favorite medium. Just play and see what works and what doesn’t. 

This is what I’m doing this month with Caran D’Ache Neocolor II water-soluble crayons. I bought some open stock colors last spring but haven’t fully explored them. So all this month on the blog (and YouTube), I’ll feature work made with this medium and share my discoveries. I hope you’ll follow along, maybe try out a few of the illustration tutorials, and [let me know how it goes](mailto:info@susannahfisher.art). So let’s talk about the Neocolors.

### What is Caran D’Ache Neocolor II?
The Neocolor II is a water-soluble wax oil pastel. They have excellent lightfastness, are creamy with excellent covering power, and are responsive to a wet brush. I’ve seen this medium used in wildlife art, children’s book illustrations, and visual journaling.

### How are Neocolor II crayons used?
You can use them wet or dry on a myriad of surfaces: paper, cardboard, glass, wood, leather, fabric, and stone. They layer beautifully, including light over dark, and have a lovely texture when used dry.

You can create some beautiful washes with thin layers of crayon activated with water or opaque layers with thicker layers. Using the crayons with water creates a flat, almost gouache-like surface. You can burnish and blend them dry, which leaves the waxy layer intact for a glossier texture.

### How do I plan to use this medium?
Throughout this month, I have videos exploring different techniques with this medium alone and in combination with other media, like gouache, color pencils, and ink. These videos drop every Thursday.

#### Supplies I’ll be using
* Neocolor II Water-soluble Crayons
* Color Pencils (Luminance and Prismacolor)
* India Ink (Bombay Ink by Dr Ph Martin)
* Gouache (Winsor Newton Designer Gouache)
* Watercolor (Daniel Smith, Handmade pans from Wildthorne)
* Graphite pencils (my favorites are Blackwings for smudgy soft effects and Tombow Monos)
* Paper: Strathmore Mixed Media, Cascade Illustration Board, handmade paper, and watercolor paper.

### Using my inspiration jar
I'm pulling prompts from the inspiration jar, of course. It would be awesome if you joined me. If you don't have Neocolor II crayons, no worries. Just choose another medium you'd like to explore. The idea is to shake things up, try new things, glean inspiration, and make a mess! [Drop me an email to let me know how it's going.](mailto:info@susannahfisher.art)
