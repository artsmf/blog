This past week I’ve been laid up with a very painful foot injury. All my projects for the week, including my original post (a tour of my studio), have been put on hold. I’ve been using this time to draw in my sketchbook, to plan my future and binge-watching <a href="https://thechateau.tv/" target=”_blank”>Escape To The Chateau on the Peacock Channel</a>. I find this show incredibly inspiring as well as entertaining.

### Escape To The Chateau
This engaging program kept popping up in my recommendations on the Peacock website, but I tend to avoid these types of programs. I find that most programs I’ve seen like this end up pitting husband against wife with the premise of “will their marriage survive this?” and I hate that sort of thing. But I was in a tremendous amount of pain, irritated that my projects were delayed, and well, there was nothing else to watch.

Boy, was I wrong! This show is charming, and I fell in love with Dick, Angel, the kids, and the relatives immediately. What I love the most about this show is that they had a dream, faced an incredible amount of challenges (some of their own making), yet worked hard to figure it out and make it happen. Every year brings new hurdles to overcome, but overall they are living their vision.

### Everything Is Figuraoutable

I’ve also been reading Marie Forleo’s book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567276/everything-is-figureoutable-by-marie-forleo/" target=”_blank”>Everything Is Figuraoutable</a> at the same time, and Escape To The Chateau is the “lab” for the theories in the book. Maybe it’s obvious to most people, but since at times in my life I’ve felt utterly lost and unsure of my next move for me the program (with the book) has been delivering a life lesson I very much need to learn.

### The Pandemic Derailed My Existing Business And Crushed A New Venture
I was one of the lucky business owners who managed to keep my clients during the first year of the pandemic, and I was very grateful not to have the added stress of losing income on top of the threat of illness and death. I had an integrated marketing business for coaches who were launching online courses. But in 2021, business slowed down. A number of my clients rethought their priorities. Others took a leave of absence from their business to pursue other passions, and I never heard from them again. The wedding calligraphy venture I planned in 2019 and intended to launch for the 2020 wedding season… well, you know what happened (Covid-19, you old bastard!).

So here I am, on the couch in incredible pain, exhausted because I can’t sleep at night (again, the pain), rereading my old planning docs, and feeling askance. Where do I go from here?

And then this show appears in my life with a reminder…

### Dreams Are Worth Every Bit Of Tenacity In Your Being
I have a vision of where I want to end up - teaching, making portraits and other paintings, illustrating books, and having a little online gift shop. My vision is so specific, I even know what my studio is going to look like (big central worktable for us all to work on our projects, a resource library, sinks and countertops, a cute area to relax and have a cup of tea, cubbies for people to store their supplies and WIPs, a little garden right outside the door to work plein air, etc.).

Now it’s time for me to figure out how I’m going to get there from here. I’m definitely at the very beginning of this journey, and I’m so afraid that the first step I take can’t be the wrong one! But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this show, and from Marie’s book, it’s that the only wrong step is the one that you don’t take.

### My Next Step
