This past week I’ve been laid up with a very painful foot injury. All my projects for the week, including my original post (a tour of my studio), have been put on hold. I’ve been using this time to draw in my sketchbook, to plan my future and binge-watching <a href="https://thechateau.tv/" target=”_blank”>Escape To The Chateau</a> on the Peacock Channel. In other words, I've had time to think about my next steps.

### Escape To The Chateau
This engaging program kept popping up in my recommendations on the Peacock website, but I tend to avoid these types of programs. I find that most programs I’ve seen like this end up pitting husband against wife with the premise of “will their marriage survive this?” and I hate that sort of thing. But I was in a tremendous amount of pain, irritated that my projects were delayed, and well, it was set in France. Anything French comforts and entertains me.

The show is charming, and I fell in love with Dick, Angel, the kids, and the relatives immediately. What I love the most about this show is that they had a dream, faced an incredible amount of challenges (some of their own making), yet worked hard to figure it out and make it happen. Every year brings new hurdles to overcome, but overall they are living their vision and loving every minute of their journey.

### Everything Is Figuraoutable
I’ve also been reading Marie Forleo’s book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567276/everything-is-figureoutable-by-marie-forleo/" target=”_blank”>Everything Is Figuraoutable</a> at the same time, and Escape To The Chateau is the “lab” for the lessons in resiliency found in the book. Maybe it’s obvious to most people, but since at times in my life I’ve felt utterly lost and unsure of my next move for me the program (with the book) has been delivering a life lesson I very much need to learn.

### The Pandemic Derailed My Existing Business And Crushed A New Venture
I was one of the lucky business owners who managed to keep enough of my clients to keep my business afloat during the first year of the pandemic. I was very grateful not to have the added stress of losing income on top of the threat of illness and death. I had an integrated marketing business for coaches who were launching online courses. But in 2021, business slowed down. A number of my clients rethought their business models. Others took a leave of absence from their businesses to pursue other passions, and I never heard from them again. The wedding calligraphy venture I planned in 2019 and intended to launch for the 2020 wedding season… well, you know what happened!

As a result, I threw myself into my art training, made plans, scrapped plans, worked with my few remaining integrated marketing clients, and realized it was time for me to move on, too. The integrated marketing projects are finishing up for the year, and I think this is my cue to move forward with my dreams.
### Dreams Are Worth Every Bit Of Tenacity In Your Being
My main takeaway from the program is that your dreams are worth the struggle. You are worth the struggle. I have a vision of where I want to end up - teaching, making portraits and other paintings, illustrating books, and having a little online gift shop. My vision is so specific, I even know what my studio is going to look like (big central worktable to work on projects, a resource library, sinks and countertops, a cute area to relax and have a cup of tea, cubbies and flat files for storage, a little garden right outside the door to work plein air, stations for bookbinding, painting, printing, filming online course, etc.).

Now it’s time for me to figure out how I’m going to get there from here. I’m definitely at the very beginning of this journey, and I’m so anxious that the first step I take can’t be the wrong one! But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this show, and from Marie’s book, it’s that the only wrong step is the one that you don’t take.
### What's next?
I'm thinking the following three steps need to be taken in this order over the next 7 days:
1. **Clean and reorganize my existing studio.** It's a small second-floor room in my home. I can't have a big central table, but I can have a corner dedicated to painting and a desk dedicated to illustration/calligraphy/filming tutorials, and even a table to bind artists' books. It'll be very cozy!
2. **Dust off my calligraphy business plans and get ready for the 2023 wedding season.** I had planned to specialize in wedding calligraphy, but I'd like to build on my original idea. I don't know what that will look like, but it will fit the times.
3. **Start a nature journaling newsletter.** This may seem random to you, dear reader, but this is a passion project of mine. Nature has never failed to delight and comforts me. And keeping a nature journal has made me feel connected to my environment in ways I'd like to share in a newsletter so that others may find the joy and grounding (no pun intended!) that I have found.

So there you have it. An accountability list masquerading as a blog post. Next week I'll have that studio tour originally intended for today (and I can check #1 off the list of my next steps). What are your dreams and your next steps? [Send me an email to let me know](mailto:info@susannahfisher.art) and I'll help you stay accountable, too! xo
