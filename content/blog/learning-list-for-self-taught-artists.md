I’m a researcher at heart, so whenever I want to learn something I hit the books, search Google, and experiment until I’ve acquired the knowledge and skills I’m interested in. It is no different for my atelier studies.

Because I’m not in a position to take three years to study full-time in an atelier program (oh, but I would if I could!), I’ve figured out a way around that obstacle with a self-study atelier program.

The program I use for myself is heavily dependent on books in place of live teachers, hours and hours of focused practice, and the occasional workshop or video as funds allow.

I was also able to participate in the Portrait Society of America’s annual conferences in 2020 and 2021 because they were virtual (and affordable). I highly recommend you attend conferences in your chosen niche - both online and in-person (if it’s safe/low-risk).

Below you will find the resources as well as some tips for designing a self-study atelier program like mine. This isn’t the only way to go about it, but it’s the way I do it, and I hope sharing it in this series will be helpful to you.

## Books
### The books I use all the time
#### Juliette Aristides books and the ones I like the best
The core of my “curriculum,” for lack of a better term, is based on the books by Juliette Aristides. She was the director of the Aristides Atelier at the Gage Academy of Fine Art. Classical Drawing Atelier and Classical Painting Atelier were the first books I bought, back when I was still dreaming and wishing I had the talent to be a classical realist artist. But it wasn’t until I got my hands on Lessons in Classical Drawing that I began to think I could try again.

Lessons in Classical Drawing - as well as its sister book, Lessons in Classical Painting - is like an atelier program in a book. It’s a very deep, comprehensive dive into learning to see and then express in two dimensions what you see. Aristides thoroughly explains the techniques to give the illusion of the three-dimensional world as your eyes perceive it as well as the reasoning behind it. Her tone is compassionate and encouraging. She recently published books (at the writing of this post) - Beginning Drawing Atelier and Figure Drawing Atelier - that can function as “exercise” books and are nice companion tomes.

Lessons in Classical Painting has the same motivating tone, and although the book is geared to oil painting I have found it invaluable for my own medium of pastel.
#### Ellen Eagle Book
After taking that workshop with Sophie Ploeg (see my previous post) [insert link] , I got excited about pastels and looked up everything I could about them. This is how I found Ellen Eagle’s work and her book. She wrote a complete book about pastel portrait painting, in which she generously shares her process and experience. It’s a workshop in a book. In fact, it was just last summer that I was able to take an online workshop with her. She is an authentic and giving teacher. This book is always near my studio table as I refer to it frequently. 
#### Charles Bargue Drawing Course
Drawing from Bargue plates seems to be a staple for all beginning atelier students. The Bargue Drawing Course emphasizes drawing the references as perfect copies. Artists learn to see distances, lengths, angles, and the relationships between them. It’s a logical way to build drawing skills. The plates start simply and progress to more complex forms. An artist’s skills grow with the course. I recommend the book but there are resources online to download Bargue plates (see Online Resources below).

## Keeping your art practice on track and staying motivated
### Scheduling
Since I believe practice is the first priority, blocking off time for it every week is a must. But I go beyond that by dividing the year into trimesters each 10 weeks in length, like many of the atelier programs. Then I decide how many hours of practice I can devote to this for the 10 weeks and make any trade-offs necessary to make the time in my schedule.    
### Goal setting
I have a goal for each trimester so that I spend the time in focused practice. Since I model my self-study on the Florence Academy of Art’s program, my first trimester looked like this:

Goal: Complete 5 Bargue drawings in 10 weeks

Schedule: Work 2 hours a day

### Check-ins and assessment
I write down what I did each day, any questions I have to either research later or explore in the next session. I write down any feelings I have about the work, and what I’m going to do the next time. Each week I assess if I’m on track to meet my goal and make any adjustments I need to - maybe this was a heavy work week, so I need to adjust to 4 drawings in 10 weeks. Or perhaps I completed a simple Bargue and can fit an extra simple one into the trimester. 

At the end of the 10 weeks, I’ll also check my progression - did I complete all the work I assigned myself? If not, why and what do I need to adjust so that the next trimester will be more successful. I don’t waste time on regret or disappointment. I identify what went well, what didn’t, make adjustments, and move forward.
### Taking a break and having fun, while still improving your skills
I like the trimester system because the breaks are built-in. However you break up your year, make sure you take some time off. It’s also very important that you have some “fun” projects going on at the same time. Since my job is creative, I always have a project going on that isn’t as regimented as my study, and I think that’s why I can stick with it. I like to participate in an Etchr workshop or treat myself to Skillshare or Domestika courses (I actually prefer the Domestika courses).

Experimenting in my sketchbook is also a necessary practice. My sketchbooks are filled with “junk” - little pencil sketches where I try to work out a problem or practice a bit of anatomy like a hand or an ear. It has swatches of gouache and watercolor. I make ink drawings in it. It’s ugly and messy. I don’t show it to anyone, so it’s also a place where I can relax.

Get out of the studio, spend time with family and friends, read a book, go hiking, etc. Sometimes I need a complete break to refresh. So put the pencil down, go outside, and take a deep breath!
## Next week…
