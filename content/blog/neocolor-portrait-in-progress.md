A quick peek inside my sketchbook this week at one of the portraits I've been working on using Neocolor II water soluble crayons.

I made a detailed drawing in graphite pencil and then added a few washes of the crayon mixture (golden ochre, alizarin crimson, a touch of ultramarine and a lot of water). Here I'm also scribbling in the background, which I'll eventually go over with water and brush.

I'm having a blast figuring out this medium in my sketchbook, but I can't see myself using this medium like this for professional work because it's more efficient to use gouache and get the same effect.

Still if you are looking for an expressive medium, I highly recommend these. You can get very textural marks and the colors are beautiful. (I kind of ruin it by using the medium as washes of neutral colors.)
