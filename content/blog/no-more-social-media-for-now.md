As artists in the 21st century, we are told that we NEEEEEEED social media if we are going to create any type of a credible career. But do we? That's what I'm trying to figure out now because I've realized that social media no longer "sparks joy."

### This Is NOT About Bashing Social Media
I love - or rather loved - social media. In the early days of social media, I was totally on board. It was entertaining. I enjoyed the Facebook boards I belonged to related to my hobbies - knitting, spinning, and embroidery. I met fiber enthusiasts from all over the world. It was all focused on sharing our projects, helping each other, and giving/receiving tips about the best places to get yarn and unspun fiber.

Years later I started using social media for business, specifically Instagram. It was fun at first, too. I loved seeing and commenting on other people’s posts. People engaged with my posts. I was building a community of other art enthusiasts. It was a great platform to see other artists’ work and chat with them. I loved talking with people who loved art as much as I do.

I had always viewed social media as a fun place to network, and Instagram is uniquely suited to building relationships with other artists and clients. Lately, however, it’s failed me. And I’ve failed social media.

### I Am Not A Brand
One thing I noticed is that my colleagues who do well on social media have figured out how to become brands. This doesn’t mean they are no longer people, but that they can translate their uniqueness into a brand. It’s awesome - for them and their customers.

I researched how to become an artist brand, too, but soon realized that I don’t want to be a brand. I’m an artist, a human, a feminist, a naturalist, a seeker, etc. I want to be an artist not create content under the umbrella of “my brand.” I don't want to develop a persona. I just want to be me.

### I Am Not A Content Creator
As far back as childhood, I have wanted to be a creator. Sometimes my creations have been musical, sometimes visual, and sometimes written. My most satisfying creations have been in the pursuit of knowledge, expression, and beauty.

To be a content creator, my creations would be for the sake of feeding the machine known as social media. Now I am a fan of several content creators on social media. I love their persona. Their posts are entertaining. It’s their job and they are excellent at it.

My job is making art, and I put as much time and effort into my practice as they do into their content. I’ve tried also making content for the machine, and it just didn’t feel good to me.

### Social Media No Longer “Sparks Joy”
By 2012, I’d lost interest in Facebook and was focusing my efforts on building a community on Instagram. It was good for a while, but in the past few years, it seems to require an intense commitment to content creation for the platform without much return on that time investment. I think if creating content was my job, I’d be okay with sticking with it, but I’m an artist. Every hour creating content for social media is an hour stolen from my practice, from making my actual work. 

Also, I hardly ever see posts from people I follow anymore unless I toggle to the list of people I’m following.  My feed is filled with “suggested” people to follow and ads. The whole exercise just doesn’t spark joy, and I’m seeing no reason to continue with something that isn’t fun and pulls me away from my work.

### Freedom From Social Media… Mostly
So three weeks ago, I set my remaining social media channels - Instagram and Twitter - on pause for the rest of 2022, but last weekend I didn’t see any reason to stay on either platform and deleted both accounts.

I kept Pinterest and YouTube accounts because I still find them both fun and entertaining. So I’m free from most of social media, and honestly, I don’t miss either. The day after deleting my accounts felt the same as the day before, so how impactful could either of them have been?

### What Does An Artist Use Instead Of Social Media?
I have no idea what the answer is to this question, but I do know that I need to first ask myself how I want to meet people online. Who I want to spend online time with, what I want to share with them, as well as what they would like me to share - are questions that need answers.

While I figure it out I’m focusing on creating more artwork and am focused on blogging to hopefully build a community here.

### Let Me Know If You Have Art Topics You’d Like Me To Explore
I’d love to hear your thoughts, so [send me an email](mailto:info@susannahfisher.art) if you'd like with your suggested topics.

Next week, I’m making a demo video about painting with Neocolor II water-soluble crayons. I’ve been working on my technique with this fun medium, and I can’t wait to share it with you!

xo, Susannah
